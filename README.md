# STWUR_9

During the meeting you will need some additional R libraries. Install them with

```{R}
install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'survminer', 'dplyr'))
```

the first one help munging the data, the other one provides tool for survival analysis.

# Set up

You can find needed data in the `data/` directory.
In `R/exercises.R` one can view exercises prepared for the workshop and in `R/answers.R` we will be putting answers through the workshop.

A volounteer can come to tutor desk to fill the exercise in the answers sheet. For a properly solved exercises we have `Why R? Foundation`'s powerbanks.
